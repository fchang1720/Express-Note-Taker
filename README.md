# Express Note Taker

For this project, I created an application that uses the npm express. A user can create notes that will be stored on the server. The currently active note will be displayed in the center of the page while inactive notes will have their headers stored in a list on the left side. Clicking on an inactive note header will display its contents as the active note in the center of the page. While a note is open, clicking the + icon at the top right corner of the page will change the active note to become a blank note that the user can then write and save a new note. You can see the deployed version here: https://boiling-tor-05975.herokuapp.com/
